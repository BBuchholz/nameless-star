## To Do

- [ ] break each to do item out into its own slip in obsidian, with a uuid assigned

- [ ] copy the slips over into vscode and add routes to the page "to-do.md"

- repository **File Names** Should Be **Kabab-case correlatives to the Title Case used in Obsidian** (eg. "Sonic Circle - Pages - To Do.md" in Obsidian becomes "./src/pages/to-do.md" in relation to the Sonic Circle project repo top level folder)

- make sure all links are Markdown style inside Obsidian (using bracket parens notations instead of double brackets, this allows for relative linking inside the pages directory, it becomes **its own, ie. site based, privately maintained, internal wiki**)
